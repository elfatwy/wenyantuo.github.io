            <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Competitive and Perceptual Consequence of Platform Brand Entry <br>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the competitive and perceptual consequences of Amazon’s private label (PL) product entry. Using a novel search-based market definition and a rich panel of Amazon data, we estimate the market-level treatment effect via staggered Synthetic Difference-in-Differences and explore heterogeneity using Double Machine Learning. we find that Amazon PL entry leads to a significant decrease in average market prices, alongside increases in review volume and ratings. However, these changes do not translate into improved consumer value perceptions. Aspect-based sentiment analysis reveals that, post-entry, reviews shift focus from product quality to value, with both perceived quality and value becoming less favorable overall. The heterogeneous treatment analysis uncover distinct patterns: first-party products show signs of internal price compression, while many third-party sellers raise prices following PL entry—suggesting reduced competitive pressure or niche differentiation. Our findings carry key implications for regulators, platform strategists, and third-party sellers. For regulators, the study highlights anti-competitive risks that go beyond pricing. For platforms, it challenges assumptions about universal consumer benefit. And for sellers, it provides guidance on vulnerability and strategic repositioning in platform-dominated markets.<br>
